# Chemical-E-Car Microcontroller and Circuitry
Microcontroller and Circuitry component of the Chemical-E-Car Team.
We coded an Arduino in C++ and create an effective circuit to connect and control different components of the E-Car to a microcontroller. 
We used cicuito.io to design the circuitry component to it.
